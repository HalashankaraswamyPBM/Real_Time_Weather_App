# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates

## Overview

This project implements a real-time data processing system for monitoring weather conditions. It utilizes the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather data for major metros in India and provides summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. Users can input city names, set alerting thresholds, and visualize weather trends through data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Continuously retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API at configurable intervals.
- **Weather Metrics**: Displays key weather metrics such as:
  - Main weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear)
  - Current temperature (Â°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Wind speed (m/s)
  - Maximum and Minimum temperature
  - Date and time of data update
- **User Input**: Allows users to input city names to retrieve weather data.
- **Rollups and Aggregates**: Calculates daily summaries, averages, and trends over time.
- **Alerting System**: Users can set thresholds for temperature alerts, which trigger notifications.
- **Weather Forecasts**: Retrieves and summarizes weather forecasts based on predicted conditions.
